Changes the color of your hyperlinks depending on what day of the week it is.

##getDay()
Using getDay() I was able to test what day it was and apply the neccesary changes accordingly

|  0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | 

Today =
<script>
var d = new Date();
var n = d.getDay()
document.write(5+6);
</script>
