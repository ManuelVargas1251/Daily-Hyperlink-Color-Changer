# Daily Hyperlink Color Changer
Changes the color of a page's linked text depending on what day of the week it is.


## How To Use
Download js file to project and include in HTML page

```html
<script src="colorchange.js"></script>
```
Make sure you paste this code lower in the html page like the footer so that all the links will have already loaded before script runs.

This repo includes a demo `index.html` using the script. You can view a demo on my main site: [mnl.space](http://mnl.space/Daily-Hyperlink-Color-Changer/). Or you can view my pen on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/manuelvargas1251/pen/JGmZOL)
